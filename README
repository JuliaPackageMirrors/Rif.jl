Interface to the R language
===========================

R has a wealth of libraries that it would be foolish to ignore
(or try to reimplement all of them).

This packages is here to offer one to play with Julia while
calling R whenever it has library that would be needed.


To build, run 'make all' from the package's directory.

For examples, check the code in examples/ .
